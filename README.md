# Synthetic Indian Road Dataset Generation using Diffusion Models üõ£Ô∏èüöó

## Project Overview
This repository contains code for generating a synthetic Indian road dataset using diffusion models. The project involves creating photorealistic images of Indian roads with potholes, crowds, and cars using a diffusion-based generative model. The generated dataset can be used for various computer vision tasks, such as object detection and segmentation.

## Challenges
### Challenge 1: Creating Synthetic Indian Road Dataset üåü
The main challenge of this project was to create a synthetic dataset that accurately represents Indian roads. This involved generating images with realistic road conditions, including potholes, diverse crowds, and different types of vehicles.

## Code Overview
The project is implemented using Python and PyTorch. Here's an overview of the key components of the code:

- **Diffusion Model Setup**: The code sets up a diffusion model using the `diffusers` library and loads a pre-trained model for image generation.
- **Indian Roads Dataset**: The Indian roads dataset is downloaded using the `opendatasets` library. The dataset contains diverse images of Indian roads.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed and transformed into appropriate formats for training the generative model.
- **Generator and Discriminator Networks**: The generator and discriminator networks are defined using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in PyTorch. These networks are trained adversarially to generate realistic road images.
- **Training Loop**: The training loop consists of training the discriminator and generator networks iteratively to improve the quality of generated images.
- **Image Generation**: The trained generator is used to generate synthetic Indian road images, which are saved for evaluation and use.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**:
git clone https://github.com/username/synthetic-indian-road-dataset.git
